# single-page-portfolio
This is a re-design of my music portfolio website. 
It addresses some fundamental flaws of the original design - mainly that it is not scalable. 
This design uses a content grid and filters to display and sort projects.
It uses a single page to do this, with an about card and contact information that can be expanded from the nav menu.
